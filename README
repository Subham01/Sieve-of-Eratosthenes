This is a basic Java implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers below a given range, of which the default here is 1000.

Help was sourced from the New Mexico Supercomputing Challenge (challenge.nm.org). I take no credit for the design or algorithm implementation.
